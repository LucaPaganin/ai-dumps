I'm looking for reliable sources of practice questions for the Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102) exam, specifically covering the content of the following learning paths:

* Get started with Azure AI Services

* Develop generative AI apps in Azure AI Foundry

* Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service

* Develop AI agents on Azure

* Develop natural language processing solutions with Azure AI Services

* Develop computer vision solutions in Azure

* Implement knowledge mining with Azure AI Search

* Develop solutions with Azure AI Document Intelligence

I'm interested in both free and paid resources, such as MeasureUp. I'd like to find opinions and discussions from social media users, particularly on Reddit, regarding the quality, relevance, and comprehensiveness of these practice question sources in relation to the actual exam content.

Additionally, I'm curious to know if individuals preparing for this exam are using any study strategies beyond hands-on practice within their personal Azure subscriptions. This could include study groups, third-party practice exams, or summary materials.

Could you please identify potential sources for practice questions, categorize them as free or paid if possible, and summarize any relevant discussions or opinions found on Reddit regarding their effectiveness? Also, please list any alternative study strategies that are commonly mentioned by those preparing for the AI-102 exam.
